# Contributing to Haidra Deployments

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Haidra-Org/deployments.git
cd deployments

# Set up the Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install ansible ansible-lint
```

See the [Quick Start guide](QUICKSTART.md) for running local deploys and
tests.

## Making changes

1. **Create a branch** from `main`.
2. **Make your changes** in the relevant role under `roles/`.
3. **Run the render tests** for the role you changed:
   ```bash
   ./tests/run_tests.sh ai_horde         # or: monitoring, frontpage, artbot, etc.
   ```
4. **Run integration tests** if your change affects cross-role behavior:
   ```bash
   ./tests/run_tests.sh integration
   ./tests/run_tests.sh full_stack
   ```
5. **Test locally** if your change affects runtime behavior:
   ```bash
   ./tests/ai_horde/local_deploy.sh up --latest
   # verify your change, then:
   ./tests/ai_horde/local_deploy.sh down
   ```

## Test conventions

- Test playbooks live in `tests/<suite>/` and are named `test_*.yml`.
- Tests must be **idempotent**: zero changed tasks on a second run.
  If intentionally non-idempotent, add `# idempotency: skip` in the first 5
  lines.
- Prefer **render-only** tests (`start_services: false`) that assert file
  content, permissions, and template output.
- Use **runtime tests** only when behavior can't be proven by rendering.
- See the [testing conventions](.github/instructions/ansible-role-testing.instructions.md)
  for the full guide.

## Repository structure

| Path | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `roles/` | Ansible roles — the source of truth for deployment logic |
| `examples/` | Example playbooks and inventory templates |
| `tests/` | Render tests, integration tests, and local deploy scripts |
| `local-deploy/` | Generated configs and Docker Compose files for local runs |
| `docs/` | Operational guides (monitoring, backup, migration, upgrades) |

See [`README.md`](README.md) for the full role map and documentation index.

## Pull requests

- Run the relevant test suite(s) before opening a PR.
- Keep changes focused — one role or concern per PR when possible.
- Include a brief description of what changed and why.
- If you add or modify a test, update the
  [test coverage map](docs/plans/maintainability-gaps/test-coverage-map.md)
  if applicable.
